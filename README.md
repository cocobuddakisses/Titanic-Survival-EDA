# Titanic-Survival-EDA

This project is a simple exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset.
It covers:

Data cleaning (dropping irrelevant columns, handling missing ages)

Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode of survivor ages)

Visualizations (age distribution, survival by class, survival by gender)

Key insights summarized in plain English

Key findings:

There were 342 survivors with an average age of about 28 years.

233 females survived compared to 109 males, showing a clear gender impact.

Most survivors were aged 20â€“35, plus some children.

1st class passengers had the highest survival rate, followed by 3rd and then 2nd class.

Tools used: Python, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib.

âœ… How to run
Open the notebook in Jupyter or Colab and run each cell top to bottom.
Make sure you have pandas and seaborn installed.

This is a beginner-friendly project â€” part of my data science self-study roadmap.
